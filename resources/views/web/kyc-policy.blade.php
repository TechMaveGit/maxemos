                        <p>The Reserve Bank of India has issued comprehensive guidelines on Know Your Customer (KYC) norms and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) standards and has advised all NBFCs to ensure that a proper policy framework on KYC and AML measures be formulated and put in place with the approval of the Board. The objective of RBI guidelines is to prevent NBFCs being used, intentionally or unintentionally by criminal elements for money laundering activities. The guidelines also mandate making reasonable efforts to determine the identity and beneficial ownership of accounts, source of funds, the nature of customer’s business, reasonableness of operations in the account in relation to the customer’s business, etc. which in turn helps the Company to manage its risks prudently. Accordingly, the main objective of this policy is to enable the Company to have positive identification of its customers.</p>

                RISK LEVEL CATEGORIZATION 
</h2></div>
                </div>

                <div class="cmn_area">
                       <p>i. The Company shall categorize its customers based on the risk perceived by the Company. The levels of categorization would be Low Risk, Medium Risk and High Risk. The risk categorization would be a function of the industry the borrower operates in, the geography in which the borrower operates, the shareholding pattern of the entity etc.</p>
                       <p>ii. The profile of new customers will be prepared on risk categorization basis. Such profile will contain the following information about the new customers:</p>
                      <p>Customer’s Identity<br>Social/Legal and financial status of the customer<br>Nature of the business activity<br>Information about the business of the customer’s clients and their locations</p>
                        <p>iii. There will be level-wise categorization of customers i.e. Level-I, Level-II and Level-III. Such levels will be decided based on risk element involved in each case which will be determined by considering the following information submitted by the customer:</p>
                        <p>Nature of business of the Customer and of his Clients<br>Work place of Customers and of his Clients<br>Country of Origin<br>Source of funds<br>Volume of business six-monthly / annual turn-over<br>Social/Legal and financial status<br>Quantum and tenure of facility applied for and proposed schedule for repayment of loan</p>
                        <p>iv. Information to be collected from the customers will vary according to categorization of customer from the point of view of risk perceived. However, while preparing customer profile the Company shall seek only such information from the customer which is relevant to the risk category and is not intrusive to the customer. Any other information from the customer should be sought separately with his/her consent and after opening the account.</p>
                        <p>v. For risk categorization, individual (other than High Net Worth) and entities whose sources of wealth can be easily identified and transactions in whose accounts by and large confirm to the known profile, may be categorized as low risk or Level-I category. Normally Level-I customers would be:</p>
                        <p>Well governed corporates<br>Salaried employees having definite and well-defined salary structure,<br>Employees of Government Departments or Government owned companies,<br>Statutory bodies,<br>Self-employed individuals, however with regular income and good credit behaviour<br>vi. Cases where the Company is likely to incur higher than average risk will be categorized as medium or high-risk customers and will be placed in medium or high risk category i.e. Level-II or Level-III category. While placing the customers in the above categories, the Company will give due consideration to the following aspects</p>
                        <p>Customer’s background,<br>Country of his origin,<br>Nature and location of his business activities,<br>Sources of funds and profile of customer’s clients etc.<br>In such cases, the Company will apply higher due diligence measures keeping in view the risk level.</p>
                        <p>vii. Special care and diligence will be taken and exercised in respect of those customers who happen to be high profile and/or Politically Exposed Persons (“PEP”) within or outside country. Such persons will include:</p>

                        <ul class="common_liststy">
<li>Foreign Delegates or those working in Foreign High commissions or Embassies,</li>
<li>Senior Politicians,</li>
<li>Senior Judicial Officers,</li>
<li>Senior Military Officers,</li>
<li>Senior Executives of State Owned Corporations and</li>
<li>Officials of important and leading political parties (as explained in “Annexure2”).</li>
</ul>

<p>About the accounts of PEPs, in the event of an existing customer or the beneficial owner of an existing account subsequently becoming PEP, the Company shall obtain Credit Committee approval in such cases to continue the business relationship with such person, and undertake enhanced monitoring.</p>
<p>viii. The extent of due diligence requirement will vary from case to case as the same will depend upon risk perceived by the Company while granting credit facilities to customers.</p>
<p>For the purpose of preparing customer profile only such relevant information from the customers will be sought based on which the Company can easily decide about the risk category in which the customers are to be placed. Ordinarily, the customer profile maintained by the Company will be kept confidential except for cases where the customer himself allows and/or gives consent for the use of the information given in customer profile / application form for offering other products / services of other companies / entities belonging to the Company’s group or any other legal entity with whom the Company is having any business tie-ups. However, while taking any such permission or consent of the customer for using his above referred information provided to the Company, it will be ensured that such permission / consent of the customer is unambiguous and explicit.</p>
<p>ix. Cases in which the risk level is higher will require intensive due diligence exercise. Such cases will include those where the sources of funds to be used for business operations or sources to repay the loan to the Company are not clearly disclosed or cannot be ascertained from the financial statements submitted by the customer to the Company. Besides above, some of such customers in whose cases the Company will require higher due diligence measures, especially those for whom the source of funds is not clear, are mentioned below:</p>

<ul class="common_liststy">
<li>NRI Customers</li>
<li>Trusts (except trusts appropriately set up under a specific regulation)</li>
