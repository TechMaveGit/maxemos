                      <h2>2. ESTABLISHING AN INTEREST RATE</h2>
                      <p>The interest rate applicable to each loan account, within the applicable range is assessed on a case specific basis, based on evaluation of various factors detailed below:</p>
                      <p><strong>a) Tenor of the Loan :-</strong> The interest rate charge will depend on the term of the loan.</p>
                      <p><strong>b) Tenure of Repayment :-</strong> The product offering consist mainly of secured and unsecured loans to MSEs & individuals carrying of business activity, with repayment period varying from case to case basis, depending upon cash flow of the prospective borrower. The focus will be to keep it on an average around 24 months, which may go up to maximum period up to 60 months or more in exceptional cases. The product category also consists of unsecured loans to Group Borrowers for periods ranging usually from 12 – 24 months. The clientele of the company can be categorized into high risk category. Therefore, considering the product offering and the absence of tangible securities in most cases, the risk of recovery can be considered to be in the medium to high category and accordingly the risk premium would be reckoned.</p>
                      <p><strong>c) Internal and External Costs of Funds :-</strong> The rate at which the funds necessary to provide loan facilities to customers are sourced, normally referred to as our external cost of funds. Internal cost of funds being the expected return on equity; is also a relevant factor. Further, the rationale is based on reasonable assumptions towards cost of funds, administrative/operational cost and risk premium which will be subject to review when felt necessary. The company would be offering fixed rate of interest.</p>
                      <p><strong>d) Internal cost loading:-</strong> The costs of doing business. Factors such as the complexity of the transaction, capital risk weightage, the size of the transaction, location of the borrower and other factors that affect the costs associated with a particular transaction would be taken into account before arriving at the final interest rate quoted to a customer.</p>
                      <p><strong>e) Customer Requirement :-</strong> The final lending rate would take the above factors into consideration and in addition factors such as profile of the borrower, their repayment track record, tenure of relationship with the borrowers, future potential, nature of primary and secondary security offered etc. Such information would be gathered on the basis of information furnished by the customers, market intelligence gathered by our CDOs / CUs and Credit Information Reports preferably from two agencies besides the competition pricing</p>
                      <p><strong>f) Credit Risk :-</strong> As a matter of prudence, credit loss (risk) cost would be factored into all transactions. The amount of credit risk cost applicable to a particular transaction depends on the internal assessment of the credit strength of the customer.</p>
                      <p><strong>g) Structuring Premium :-</strong> A premium may be applied to a loan in case the loan has any significant structuring elements with respect to collateral, or other aspects of transaction structure.</p>
                      <p><strong>h) Margin :-</strong> The rate of interest is arrived on reasonable assumption towards the average cost of funds, administrative costs, risk premium and a reasonable margin for the Company.</p>
