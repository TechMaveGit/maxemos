                        <p>India is truly a digital-first economy, and technology can speed up the development of industries and markets with phenomenal success. It can also allow for the rapid growth of unscrupulous practices that can fall between regulatory grey areas. With recent strong growth in the digital lending industry in India, there is a need for industry participants to maintain a strong code of conduct in order to prevent the rise of unscrupulous practices that could cause harm to the industry by reducing the confidence of customers, regulators and other market participants. The purpose of this Code of Conduct is to ensure that the digital lending industry creates common safeguards of customer interests and appropriately addresses the unique risks that might be created through the mechanism of digital lending.</p>
